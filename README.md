# Dayside Aurora Dataset (GOLD Mission)

Side project with a potential for publication in the future. The current implementation thus far is the deep learning implementation of the current Ovation Prime 2010 model (with seasonal differences). This current implementation is differentiable, and thus,
is easily able to incorporate different datasets of the aurora for more accurate auroral forecasting. Current work is focused on now using experimental datasets, and increase the number of inputs variables from exclusively solar wind parameters to also include 
geomagnetic and thermospheric indices.
